# Research Synthesis Skill

## Purpose

Collect, analyze, and synthesize scientific research relevant to space colonization. Transform academic papers into clear, actionable knowledge that engineers and planners can use.

## Capabilities

- Literature review on specific space science topics
- Summarize key findings from multiple research papers
- Identify consensus, contradictions, and knowledge gaps
- Extract actionable engineering parameters from research
- Create annotated bibliographies with relevance scores

## Instructions

1. **Define the research question**: What specific knowledge do we need?
2. **Search and collect**: Find relevant papers, reports, and data sources
3. **Analyze and synthesize**: What do the findings tell us collectively?
4. **Produce a synthesis report** with:
   - Executive summary (3-5 sentences)
   - Key findings (numbered list)
   - Actionable parameters (numbers engineers can use)
   - Knowledge gaps (what we still don't know)
   - Recommended next steps
   - Sources with relevance ratings

## Voice

Academic precision with practical focus. Every finding should answer: "So what? How does this help us get to Mars?"
