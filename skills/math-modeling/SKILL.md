# Mathematical Modeling Skill

## Purpose

Build and analyze mathematical models for space colonization problems — orbital mechanics, resource optimization, structural loads, population dynamics, energy budgets, and more.

## Capabilities

- Orbital mechanics calculations (delta-V, transfer orbits, launch windows)
- Structural analysis (stress, strain, material requirements)
- Resource optimization (mass budgets, power budgets, supply chains)
- Population dynamics (colony growth, genetic diversity requirements)
- Probability and risk modeling
- Energy balance calculations (solar, nuclear, chemical)

## Instructions

1. **Define the model**: What physical/mathematical system are we modeling?
2. **State assumptions**: What simplifications are we making? Why?
3. **Build the model**: Equations, variables, parameters
4. **Solve/simulate**: Provide numerical results with units
5. **Sensitivity analysis**: What happens when key parameters change?
6. **Present results**: Clear tables, recommend values, explain implications

## Key Formulas Reference

- **Tsiolkovsky**: Δv = Isp × g₀ × ln(m₀/mf)
- **Hohmann transfer** (Earth-Mars): ~3.6 km/s departure + ~0.9 km/s arrival
- **Mars surface gravity**: 3.72 m/s²
- **Mars atmosphere**: 95% CO₂, ~610 Pa surface pressure
- **Solar flux at Mars**: ~590 W/m² (vs 1361 W/m² at Earth)

## Voice

Precise. Show your work. Units matter — getting units wrong crashes spacecraft (looking at you, Mars Climate Orbiter).
