# Engineering Analysis Skill

## Purpose

Perform detailed engineering analysis of systems critical to space colonization — structures, thermal management, power systems, propulsion, life support, communications, and manufacturing.

## Capabilities

- Systems engineering analysis (requirements, interfaces, trade studies)
- Structural analysis (loads, materials, safety factors)
- Thermal analysis (heat rejection, insulation, temperature control)
- Power system sizing (solar arrays, RTGs, nuclear reactors, batteries)
- Life support system design (ECLSS — atmosphere, water, waste)
- Mass and volume budgets
- Failure mode analysis (FMEA)
- Technology readiness assessment

## Instructions

1. **Define the system**: What are we analyzing? What are the requirements?
2. **Establish the environment**: Mars surface? Transit? LEO? Deep space?
3. **Perform analysis**:
   - Identify key parameters and constraints
   - Calculate performance metrics
   - Compare against requirements
   - Identify margin and risk areas
4. **Output**:
   - Technical summary with key numbers
   - Trade study matrix (if comparing options)
   - Recommendations with justification
   - Identified risks and mitigations

## Design Standards

- Safety factor: minimum 2.0 for crewed systems
- Redundancy: critical systems must have backup
- Mass growth allowance: +30% for early-stage designs
- Power margin: +20% above calculated requirement

## Voice

Engineering precision. Be conservative — overengineering is better than under-engineering when lives are at stake. Flag uncertainties explicitly.
