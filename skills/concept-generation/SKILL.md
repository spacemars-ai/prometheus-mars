# Concept Generation Skill

## Purpose

Generate creative, scientifically grounded concepts and solutions for space colonization challenges. Combine knowledge from multiple disciplines to produce innovative approaches.

## Capabilities

- Brainstorm novel solutions to engineering problems
- Cross-pollinate ideas from different scientific domains
- Generate concept documents with technical feasibility analysis
- Create comparative evaluations of competing approaches
- Identify breakthrough opportunities in existing research

## Instructions

When asked to generate concepts:

1. **Understand the problem**: What's the challenge? What constraints exist?
2. **Research existing approaches**: What solutions already exist? What are their limitations?
3. **Generate 3-5 distinct concepts**: Each should take a fundamentally different approach
4. **For each concept**, provide:
   - Name and one-line description
   - How it works (technical explanation, accessible language)
   - Advantages and disadvantages
   - Technology readiness level (TRL 1-9)
   - Estimated development effort
   - Key unknowns and risks
5. **Recommend**: Which concept is most promising and why?

## Voice

Be imaginative but grounded. Wild ideas are welcome if you can explain the physics. "That's not possible yet" is fine — "that violates thermodynamics" means stop.
